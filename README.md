# General
This project was made for optional fpga project during F23 Computer Architecture course. 

It contains Quartus Project for turning fpga board into morse coder.

Python is used to generate verilog code to process morse table.
Features:
- Morse decoding
- Morse encoding
- Matrix keyboard driver is included
- Developments towards the telegraph key and the use of sound signals
- Generating verilog code
_________________________________________

Remark: 

There is remaining issue with our fpga.
Our fpga is inverted so code can work inverted too on other fpga.
